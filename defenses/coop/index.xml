These references become available when using or allowing iframe and window.open. They provide some information (although limited) about the window as they still respect the Same Origin Policy.
One of the accessible attributes is window.length which provides the number of frames in the window. This attribute can give valuable information about a page to an attacker.</description></item></channel></rss>
