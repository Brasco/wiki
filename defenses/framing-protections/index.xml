These references become available when using or allowing iframe and window.open. They provide some information (although limited) about the window as they still respect the Same Origin Policy.
One of the accessible attributes is window.length which provides the number of frames in the window. This attribute can give valuable information about a page to an attacker.</description></item><item><title>Navigations</title><link>https://xsleaks.com/docs/attacks/navigations/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.com/docs/attacks/navigations/</guid><description>Detecting if a cross-site page triggered a navigation (or didn&amp;rsquo;t) can be useful to an attacker. For example, a website may trigger a navigation in a certain endpoint depending on the status of the user.
To detect if any kind of navigation occurred, an attacker can:
Use an iframe and count the number of times the onload event is triggered. Check the value of History.length, accessible through any window reference.</description></item><item><title>Network Timing</title><link>https://xsleaks.com/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/network-timing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.com/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/network-timing/</guid><description>Network Timing side-channels have been present on the web since its beginning 1 2. These attacks achieved different levels of impact over time, gaining new attention when browsers started shipping high precision timers like performance.now().
To obtain timing measurements attackers must use a clock, either an implicit or explicit one. These clocks are usually interchangeable and only vary in accuracy and availability. For simplicity, this article will only address the performance.</description></item><item><title>Execution Timing</title><link>https://xsleaks.com/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/execution-timing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.com/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/execution-timing/</guid><description>Measuring the time of JavaScript execution in a browser can give attackers information on when certain events are triggered, and how long some operations take.
Timing the Event Loop # JavaScript concurrency model is based on a single-threaded event loop which means it can only run one task at a time. If, for example, some time-consuming task blocks the event loop, the user can perceive a freeze on a page as a result of the UI thread being starved.</description></item><item><title>ID Attribute</title><link>https://xsleaks.com/docs/attacks/id-attribute/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.com/docs/attacks/id-attribute/</guid><description>The id attribute is widely used to identify some HTML elements. Unfortunately, these ids can be leaked by leveraging the focus event and the URL fragment. For example, some web applications set id attributes in focusable elements that may lead to user information disclosure. These ids can either be direct information related to the user (e.g a secret) or information associated with a user state (e.g account status). There are two alternatives to complete this attack:</description></item></channel></rss>
