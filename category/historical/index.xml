It ensures a certain MIME type must be enforced when loading an object verifying if the Content-Type of the resource is the same as the one provided in the object. Unfortunately, this enforcement would allow attackers to leak the Content-Type and Status Codes returned by a website 1
Root Cause # Considering the snippet below, not_loaded would be rendered if the returned Content-Type of https://target/api did not match the one in type, or the server returned a status different than 200.</description></item><item><title>WebKit - ITP</title><link>https://xsleaks.com/docs/attacks/historical/itp/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.com/docs/attacks/historical/itp/</guid><description>Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) is a privacy feature part of WebKit Tracking Prevention technologies. Itâ€™s a conjunction of several features to prevent a website from tracking a user under a third-party context. Unfortunately, the initial design introduced a new XS-Leak 1, allowing attackers to abuse the states implicitly created by ITP to classify websites as trackers.
Root Cause # To classify whether a website had tracking capabilities, ITP collects statistics on resource loads as well as user interactions in websites such as clicks, taps, or text entries.</description></item></channel></rss>
