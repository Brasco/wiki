Getting access to a website's `window` object is a common prerequisite for different XS-Leak techniques. [Framing Protections]({{< ref "xfo.md" >}}) can ensure that an attacker cannot use iframes to access the `window` object, but this does not stop an attacker from accessing it from an opened window through `window.open(url)` or `window.opener` references. 

Exploiting XS-Leaks with `window.open` is generally seen as the least appealing option because the user can see it happen in the open browser window. However, it's usually the right technique when:

- A page sets [Framing Protections]({{< ref "xfo.md" >}})
- A page sets [Same-Site Cookies with `Lax` Mode]({{< ref "same-site-cookies.md" >}}) (since navigating a new window is a top-level navigation, it bypasses this)

To prevent other websites from gaining arbitrary window references to a page, applications can deploy Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) [^1] [^2]. With COOP, applications are in control of who is allowed to have a reference to their pages, thus mitigating XS-Leaks which make use of such techniques.

## Considerations

Since COOP is an opt-in mechanism and a very recent one, it can easily be overlooked by developers and security engineers. Nonetheless, itâ€™s important to highlight the importance of this defense mechanism as it is the only way to prevent attackers from exploiting XS-Leaks which makes use of window references returned by APIs like `window.open` (unless Same-Site Cookies Strict Mode can be widely deployed).
