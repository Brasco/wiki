This protection was created to defend against speculative side-channel attacks such as Spectre that allow attackers to read the memory of their own process. CORB aims to prevent attackers from loading certain sensitive cross-origin resources into an attacker controlled process. For example, if the attacker tries to load cross-origin HTML, XML, or JSON into an img tag, CORB will prevent this from happening.</description></item><item><title>Partitioned HTTP Cache</title><link>https://xsleaks.com/docs/defenses/browser-default/partitioned-cache/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.com/docs/defenses/browser-default/partitioned-cache/</guid><description>Cache probing attacks have been present on the web for a long time. Cache probing relies on the fact that browsers' HTTP cache is shared across all the websites visited by a user.
Browsers are actively working on implementing a partitioned HTTP cache that would in essence ensure each website has a distinct cache. This is done via using tuples (either (top-frame-site, resource-url) or (top-frame-site, framing-site, resource-url)) as the cache keys to ensure the cache is partitioned by the requesting site.</description></item></channel></rss>
