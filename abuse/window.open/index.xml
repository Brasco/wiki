For example, a website may trigger a navigation in a certain endpoint depending on the status of the user.
To detect if any kind of navigation occurred, an attacker can:
Use an iframe and count the number of times the onload event is triggered. Check the value of history.length, accessible through any window reference.</description></item><item><title>Cache Probing</title><link>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/cache-probing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/cache-probing/</guid><description>The principle of Cache Probing consists of detecting whether some resource was cached by the browser. The concept is known since the beginning of the web 1 and initially relied on detecting timing differences.
When a user visits a website some resources such as images, scripts, and HTML content are fetched and later cached by the browser (under certain conditions). This optimization will make future navigations faster as the browser will serve those resources from disk instead of requesting them again.</description></item></channel></rss>
