Unfortunately blocking certain types of requests introduced a new type of XS-Leaks, allowing attackers to detect if CORB was enforced in one request, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t on another. Nevertheless, the introduced XS-Leaks are much less problematic than the issues actively protected by CORB (e.g Spectre).
CORB &amp;amp; Error Events # Attackers can observe when CORB is enforced if a response returns a CORB protected Content-Type (and nosniff) with status code 2xx which results in CORB stripping the body and Headers from the response.</description></item><item><title>CORP Leaks</title><link>https://xsleaks.com/docs/attacks/browser-features/corp/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xsleaks.com/docs/attacks/browser-features/corp/</guid><description>Explanation # Cross-Origin Resource Policy (CORP) is a web platform security feature which enforces CORB. Unfortunately, similarly to CORB XS-Leak applications can introduce a new XS-Leak if they misconfigure the use of this protection.
A webpage will introduce an XS-Leak if CORP is enforced based on user data. If a page search feature enforces CORP when showing results, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t when returning no results, an attacker will be able to distinguish the two scenarios.</description></item></channel></rss>
